To Do List


It is now available as a chrome extension! 

In order to use as a chrome extension:
1. download the repository
2. go to chrome://extensions
3. click on load unpacked
4. select the folder you downloaded the files to

This project overrides the New Tab page, meaning you'll have access to your to do list anytime you open up a new page!

This was just a small venture for me to practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript and to learn jQuery and how to use Javascript Canvas.

Hope you enjoy!
